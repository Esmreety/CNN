Explanation of CNN model:

The 1st hidden layer is a convolution layer and 32 filters each of size 5*5 is used followed by a maxpooling layer with a pool size of 2*2. Another convolution layer with 64 filters with size 5*5 each foolowed by a maxpooling layer with a pool size of 2*2. The next layer is Flatten layer that converts 2D matrix data to 1D vector before builfing fully connected layer. After that a fully connected layer with 1024 neurons and relu activation function is used. And then Dropout regularization is used to reduce overfitting.  We add a dense layers at the end which is used for class prediction (0â€“9). That is why it has 10 neurons. It is also called output layer. This layer uses softmax activation function instead of ReLU.
